Task 3:  
Write a script or a program that reads a text file containing an inverted index, creates the 
TF-IDF weights matrix and saves it in a file. 
Your program should take two parameters: input file name out file name.  
Input file can be assumed is a representation of an inverted index where each line contains 
the term and identifiers of documents where that term occurs in. 
Your output file should contain the weights matrix, document identifiers as the header of 
each column and terms as the first column.  
sample in file: (columns will be TAB delimited) 
sample D1 D2 
document D1 D2 
second D2 

 

sample out file (columns must be TAB delimited) 
 D1 D2 
sample 0 0 
document 0 0 
second 0 0.301
