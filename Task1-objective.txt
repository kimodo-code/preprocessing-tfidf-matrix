Task 1:
Write a script or a program that reads a text file, pre-processes it and saves 
the results into a new file. The text file contains documents, one document per line. 
Each document is one or several sentences. 
Your program should take three parameters: input file name,  output file name, stopword 
list  
It should pre-process documents so that they can be later used to create an inverted index. 
Basic pre-processing should consider: 
punctuation 
tokenization 
lower-casing/upper-casing / punctuation / numbers 
stop word removal (sample list will be provided, comma separated list of words) 
stemming must use one of the Porter stemmer libraries  

 

Your program should write the pre-processed documents into the output file. 
sample input file: 
D1 This is a sample document 
D2 This is a second document. This one has more sentences. 
D3 The name of the document is spaced by a TAB character! all docs are on a single line 
sample output file 
D1 sample document 
D2 second document more sentence 
D3 name document space tab character doc single line
